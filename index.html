                My name is Mason, I'm a third year student at Champlain College and all my life my parents have introduced me to movies 
                that they watched growing up and because of that I found a love for movies! Because of this, for my COR-304 midterm 
                project, I knew I wanted to cover something movie-related. 2023 has been a huge comeback year for Hollywood as they 
                were still working on transitioning back to in person movies after the pandemic. Additionally, some movies that were 
                planned to release earlier got pushed back as far as 2023. So for this project I decided to talk about some of the 
                biggest movies of 2023 and their effect on pop culture. So to get a start, I interviewed my local movie theater's 
                movie coordinator, Zackary Quick, who every week picks what movies are shown at the theater! The main thing I wanted 
                to focus on was which movies made the biggest splash in pop culture this past year (2023). Though it's not a 
                comprehensive list, he was able to come up with a couple of the big ones for this year that made the biggest impact, 
                and those were the most popular! On this website, I explore some of the movies encompassed in that list, what they 
                were about, who was involved, how they were received, some of the reasons they were so popular, and what effect they 
                had on pop culture as a whole!

                    Potentially the most popular movie of the year, <em>Barbie</em> was absolutely huge! One of the big reasons this was one of the
                     most popular movies of the year was because of who was involved in the project. First, it was written and directed by 
                     Greta Gerwig, who had already directed other popular movies such as <em>Lady Bird</em> and <em>Little Women</em>. Second, it had a really 
                     star-studded cast with actors like Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrel, Michael Cera, and cameos from people like 
                     John Cena! All of these people are huge names in the world of pop culture, and their appearances alone in a movie are 
                     bound to draw a crowd! Aside from the people involved in the project, the whole movie revolved around the nostalgia of 
                     the concept of Barbie. The doll everyone used to play with when they were younger. In these ways, the movie leveraged 
                     pop culture to really draw a crowd to the theaters! As a result, this movie was turned into memes and gifs, and the 
                     music was used in all sorts of social media, making it really have a huge impact on pop culture. Never had the theaters 
                    been more pink than the month <em>Barbie</em> came out!

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>Oppenheimer</em> was a fantastic movie that told the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb. 
                    Along with all the other movies on this list, <em>Oppenheimer</em> had a star-studded cast, including actors like Cillian Murphy, 
                    Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. Not only did it have a star-studded cast, but it was also directed by 
                    Christopher Nolan, who has directed many other famous movies such as <em>The Dark Knight</em> trilogy, <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>Inception</em>, 
                    and <em>The Prestige</em>. One of the biggest splashes this movie made in the world of pop culture was Oppenheimer's shared meme 
                    with <em>Barbie</em>. Of course I'm talking about "Barbenheimer." Both <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em> opened in theaters on July 21st, 2023. 
                    As you probably know, if you know anything about either of the movies, it is that they have completely different tones. 
                    <em>Oppenheimer</em> is about creating a bomb during World War II, while <em>Barbie</em> is about dolls that come to life. This, of course, 
                    sparked the idea in people's minds of doing a <em>Barbie/Oppenheimer</em> double feature. This was huge in pop culture for the months 
                    leading up to and following the release of <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em>. I would even go so far as to argue that "Barbenheimer" 
                    was one of the biggest pop culture events of the year!

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em> is a continuation of <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> and is one of two parts. 
                    It follows Miles Morales as one of many Spider-Men across the multiverse and largely focuses on comic book adaptations 
                    of Spider-Man. One of the things that made this movie really popular was its animation style, in that it was animated to 
                    look as if it were a comic book, which is really something that was revolutionary when the first Spider-Verse movie came 
                    out. This movie brought in a couple stars to really sell their movie, like Oscar Isaac, Jason Schwartzman, and Jake Johnson! 
                    On top of its cast and incredible animation style, it's also renowned for its incredible soundtrack. This movie showed up 
                    in a lot of forms in memes across social media, specifically with Oscar Isaac's character, Spider-Man 2099. This movie also 
                    pulled a twist toward the end when it revealed itself to be the first part of a two-part story, which both excited and let 
                    down audiences. On one hand, it got people all excited for another Spider-Verse movie to come out, but on the other hand, 
                    it let people down who were looking for an ending to the story that got started. The first Spider-Verse movie in 2018 set 
                    a high standard for the future of Spider-Verse movies, and that expectation was certainly exceeded with this movie, which 
                    has set an even higher precedent for <em>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</em>, which is expected to release sometime in 2025!

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was a huge hit with a lot of audiences, but not so much with the critics, so much so that 
                    on rotten tomatoes, it got a 59% with critics and a 95% audience score! A lot of this is definitely due to the nostalgia 
                    of a lot of 90's and 2000's kids reliving their childhood memories of playing the game! Of course, there was also Bowser's 
                    song, Peaches, that managed to really sneak its way into the hearts of audiences and into pop culture! For months after 
                    the release date of the movie, the song was in people's social media feeds and even on the radio! The movie also had a 
                    pretty huge cast of stars, including Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Jack Black, and Seth Rogan! One of the more controversial 
                    topics in relation to the movie was the casting of Chris Pratt as Mario. People's biggest issue with the casting was that 
                    there wasn't a real attempt to recreate the classic Mario voice, and instead it just sounded like Chris Pratt's regular voice. 
                    Unfortunately, this trend doesn't seem to be stopping, as Chris Pratt was also cast as the voice of Garfield in <em>The Garfield 
                    Movie</em>, releasing in 2024, and is once again just using his regular voice. Overall, <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was a pretty 
                    huge hit with audiences, largely due to the nostalgia of reliving the feeling of playing the Super Mario Bros. game when they 
                    were younger, and it made a pretty big wave in pop culture due to its popularity and hilarious songs!

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning</em> was a pretty pleasant surprise for critics, but it continued its great reputation with 
                    audiences. The Mission Impossible movies for the last two decades have really been on the uptrend. Since the disaster of 
                    <em>Mission Impossible II</em>, the movies have only gotten better, with <em>Mission Impossible: Fallout</em> being arguably the best in 
                    the franchise! To the excitement of the viewers, this movie didn't disappoint! From beginning to end, people were kept on 
                    the edge of their seats for the classic Mission Impossible thrill! Some of the excitement of the Mission Impossible movies 
                    is that for every movie, Tom Cruise will perform some crazy, dangerous, physics-defying stunt and baffle his fans! In the 
                    past, he has been free climbing in <em>Mission Impossible II</em>, learned how to hold his breath for six minutes, and even hung 
                    off the side of a plane as it took off in <em>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation</em>! Dead Reckoning was no different, as Tom Cruise 
                    took to the skies as he drove a motorcycle off a cliff and used a parachute to land on a train! This movie kept up the 
                    standard of Mission Impossible stunts and really pushed the expectations and boundaries of action movies!

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes</em> is a movie that serves as a prequel to the original Hunger Games movies!
                     It follows a young President Snow and focuses on the story of how he came to power. The movie was directed by Francis Lawrence, 
                     who had also directed the last three Hunger Games movies: Catching Fire and Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2. This movie was pretty 
                     nostalgic for a lot of people who were either fans of the books or the movies. One of the biggest impacts this movie had 
                     in the pop culture world was how the actors were received and the impacts they made on social media. For months after 
                     the release of the movie, there were posts on Instagram thirsting for young President Snow. One of the interesting things 
                     about this movie's advertising is that they really used social media platforms to the max to advertise their movie by having 
                     cast members make TikTok and Instagram reels about the movie and the original movies! I think this movie is one of the first 
                     of many that will really start to rely on social media as an advertising platform!
