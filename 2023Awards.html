                Every year there are many awards ceremonies that honor movies for outstanding writing, directing, acting and much more! 
                This year of course was no different, from the Oscars, to Golden Globes, to Screen Actors Guild Awards many movies were 
                honored this year for truly outstanding work. On this page I'll showcase a couple of awards that some of the movies on 
                the previous page won and talk a little bit more about each one!

                    <em>Barbie</em> did a phenomenal job with its nominations but didn't end up making as big of a splash in terms of award wins. 
                    Many people believe it was robbed of a lot of Oscars, and social media threw a huge fit about Ryan Gosling being 
                    nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor but Margot Robbie not being nominated for Best Actress. This sparked 
                    a whole debate in pop culture about whether Margot Robbie was cheated out of an award or not. The less discussed 
                    nomination was for America Ferrera for Best Supporting Actress. While she was no Margot Robbie, the community was 
                    glad to have some female representation in the awards ceremony. Overall, <em>Barbie</em> was nominated for a ton of awards 
                    this season across multiple ceremonies, including the SAG Awards, People's Choice Awards, Critic's Choice Awards, 
                    and Golden Globes. Even though it only took home a handful, I'd still consider it a win for <em>Barbie</em>.

                    <em>Oppenheimer</em> had a clean sweep this award season! From Best Picture to Best Original Score, <em>Oppenheimer</em> took home a total 
                    of 7 Oscars alone! Not to mention all the awards it won at other award ceremonies. Christopher Nolan is a renound 
                    director who has already made a huge splash in pop culture, which partially contributed to the success of <em>Oppenheimer</em>, 
                    not to mention the bonus advertising it got from the "Barbenheimer" trend on social media. Along with <em>Oppenheimer</em>, but 
                    not mentioned on this page, is Poor Things, starring Emma Stone, which dominated this year's Oscar ceremony. It is also 
                    important to note that the awards listed above are just a fraction of the awards <em>Oppenheimer</em> won and was nominated for!

                    <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em> did a lot better with its fans than it did with its awards. A truly excellent 
                    movie with a fantastic soundtrack was a bit overshadowed by some of the other fantastic movies that came out this 
                    year. Similarly to the 1995 Oscars, where <em>Forrest Gump</em>, <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, and <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em> all came out 
                    in the same year, All were fantastic movies, but <em>Forrest Gump</em> took a lot of wins that year. This year, there were 
                    just so many other good movies that, unfortunately, <em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em> got overlooked in many areas.

                    While The Super Mario Bros. Movie did get nominated for some awards in comparison to some of the other popular ones 
                    that came out this year, it really didn't do all that well. As mentioned on the previous page of this website, while 
                    this movie made a huge impact in the pop culture world and was loved by fans, critics didn't enjoy it quite as much. 
                    Because of this, since most awards ceremonies are run by critics, it didn't do quite as well as some of the other 
                    movies on this list.

                    While Mission: Impossible also didn't get as much recognition as many other movies on this page, it's important to 
                    note that Mission: Impossible is not generally an "award movie". Mission: Impossible is generally thought of as a 
                    stereotypical action movie, which isn't too far off, but Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning really pushed the 
                    boundaries of action movies with their incredible sound design, visual effects, and stunts!

                    The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes came out towards the tail end of 2023, and because of that, it 
                    wasn't recognized in every awards ceremony. The one spot where this movie really killed it was at the People's 
                    Choice Awards! This is because it made a huge splash in pop culture due to its nostalgia and marketing strategies 
                    mentioned on the previous page. While it may not have been the biggest hit at every award ceremony this year, it 
                    made a big enough impact on pop culture to take home a couple People's Choice awards!
