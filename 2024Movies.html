                2024 is shaping up to be a very exciting year for movies. With 2023 coming out with a strong comeback for movies after 
                COVID, it's looking like 2024 will meet the standard that 2023 set! Once again, I talked with my local theater's movie 
                coordinator, Zackary Quick, about some movies coming out in 2024 that are expected to make the biggest impact on pop 
                culture as a whole. On this page, I showcase a couple of those movies and talk a little bit about what makes each of 
                them special. For more information about each movie, click on the title shown above the poster! That will redirect you 
                to the Letterboxd page for each movie, which has all the information you could look for and more!

                    At the time this website was created, <em>Dune: Part Two</em> was the only one of these movies that had already been 
                    released. This is a continuation of the first <em>Dune</em> movie that came out in 2021, directed by Denis Villeneuve 
                    and starring Timoth√©e Chalamet. <em>Dune: Part One</em> was such a huge success that fans of the series are going crazy for 
                    part two! This recreation of the original 1984 movie directed by David Lynch is exactly what sci-fi fans need! 
                    Already, this movie has made a huge impact on pop culture through social media and memes! Now fans are excited for 
                    the next installment in the Dune franchise: <em>Dune: Messiah</em>.

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>The Fall Guy</em> is a highly anticipated action-romantic comedy that's been in the works for a long time and is 
                    finally coming out in early May! This movie has a star-studded cast, primarily featuring Ryan Gosling and Emily 
                    Blunt. This movie has already taken over social media through the classic "literally me" Ryan Gosling meme, where 
                    people try to relate to Ryan Gosling's characters through things that they think are relatable or wish they could 
                    do. Anticipation for this movie has been growing for a couple years, and based on the trailers, I don't blame them! 
                    This will be one movie this summer you won't want to miss.

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>Monkey Man</em> is an action movie that was directed, written by, and starring Dev Patel, who is known for his work in 
                    <em>The Green Knight</em>, <em>Lion</em>, and <em>Hotel Mumbai</em>. The most interesting story about this movie, in my opinion, is actually 
                    about the conditions under which it was made. According to the mastermind behind the movie (Dev Patel), production 
                    was a complete disaster. This is because they started filming in March of 2020. Sound familiar? Because COVID hit 
                    just as they were starting production, they had enormous struggles getting almost anything done on set. But because 
                    of how much the team cared about the movie, they pushed through and made it work. Because of how much care was put 
                    into this movie, people are excited to see just how special it is!

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>Inside Out 2</em> is an obvious one. <em>Inside Out</em> is one of Pixar's most popular movies; it's no wonder fans were begging 
                    for a sequel! The plot of this movie revolves around the main character growing up and developing new types of 
                    feelings, such as anxiety. This has sparked a lot of jokes on social media, with people being able to relate to 
                    how anxiety is represented in this movie. This movie is exactly what people have been looking for since the first 
                    one came out nearly 10 years ago, in 2015.

                <p class="infoText">
                    <em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die</em> is the fourth movie in the Bad Boys franchise about two cops, starring Will Smith and Martin 
                    Lawrence. These movies are especially popular with people who were around when the first movies were just coming 
                    out in the 1990's and 2000's, but they also gained the ability to attract new fans when they came out with the 
                    third installment, Bad Boys for Life, in 2020, hoping to gain attention from a newer audience. Fans of the original 
                    and the new ones all over are excited for this movie to hit theaters this June 7th so they can go on another ride 
                    along with their favorite Miami police officer, Mike Lowrey!
